# CRM RESTful API with CRUD operations

This is a simple Go application that exposes a RESTful API with Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for managing a database of customers. Each customer is identified by a UUID and has a name, role, email, phone number, and a flag indicating whether they have been contacted.

This API uses the `mux` router from the Gorilla toolkit to handle HTTP requests. The `encoding/json` package is used for encoding and decoding JSON data, and UUIDs are generated using the `github.com/google/uuid` package.

## Installation

Before you can run this application, you need to have Go installed on your machine. If you do not have Go installed, you can download it from the official website [here](https://go.dev/dl/).

To get started with the application:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project's directory.
3. Run `go get github.com/gorilla/mux` and `go get github.com/google/uuid` to fetch the required dependencies.

## Running the Application

To start the application, use the `go run` command from the project's root directory:

```shell
go run main.go
```

The application will start and listen on port 3000.

## API Usage

Here are the API endpoints that you can use:

- **GET /customers**: Retrieve all customers.
- **POST /customers**: Add a new customer. The request body should be a JSON object representing the customer (without the ID, which will be generated by the server).
- **GET /customers/{id}**: Retrieve the customer with the specified UUID.
- **DELETE /customers/{id}**: Delete the customer with the specified UUID.
- **PUT /customers/{id}**: Update the customer with the specified UUID. The request body should be a JSON object representing the customer.

Note: All data is stored in memory and will be lost when the application is stopped.
